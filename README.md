# Fp-growth-implementation
My implementation fo fpgrwoth algorithm using python 3


To run the code: Python 3 is required
open a command line and type this :
  1) Install numpy if its not already installed:
         pip install numpy
  2) Install argparse library if its not already installed:
         pip install argparse

Note, changing the directory to the python file’s directory and
placing the input data file in that same directory makes it easier to
execute.


To run the program, open a command line and type:

       python fpgrowth.py ‘input-file-name’ ‘min-sup’ ‘output-file-name’
       

here, ‘input-file-name’ and ‘output-file-name’ is expected to be a string, and ‘min-sup’ is expected to be
a integer number.


It should look like this after successful compilation. The result will be saved in the output file directory
provided to the program as an argument
